        description: "I worked on developing a full-stack e-commerce management platform that simplifies product handling, order management, and inventory tracking. On the backend, I built RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js to manage products and user interactions, while on the frontend, I designed and implemented an admin dashboard using ReactJS and TypeScript for easy product updates and inventory management. To ensure smooth integration between the two, I utilized Axios for API communication and optimized performance by leveraging React state management and lifecycle methods. By collaborating with the team, I contributed to delivering a scalable, fully functional, and user-friendly platform.",

        description: 'I developed a Logistics Management System (LMS) integrated with ERP to automatically fetch customer sales orders and streamline logistics processing. The system included modules for Planning, Routing, Scheduled Orders, Delivery Orders, Invoices, and Gate Pass, all built with React.js and Node.js. I implemented routing logic to assign orders to routes and transporters, enhancing operational planning, and integrated LMS with the Inventory Management System (IMS) to manage pick-up, packing, and delivery workflows. Using Express.js and MongoDB, I automated invoice and gate pass generation after IMS processing and ensured real-time synchronization between ERP, LMS, and IMS via RESTful APIs. Additionally, I improved logistics efficiency by unifying the order-to-delivery cycle in a single application and implemented role-based access with Redux and custom hooks to manage operational workflows effectively.',

The application was secured with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control to safeguard sensitive traffic data. I also integrated data visualization components including bar graphs, line charts, and scatter plots to present traffic volumes, growth trends, and other key metrics. To ensure consistent performance and seamless data sharing across components, I structured the applicationâ€™s state management with Redux, delivering a smooth and reliable user experience.',
